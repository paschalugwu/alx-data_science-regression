# Optimizing Agricultural Yield and Population Forecasting Using Machine Learning Techniques

## Introduction

### Project Overview

This report combines three distinct projects focusing on predictive modeling using regression and decision tree techniques: optimizing agricultural yield, analyzing world population growth, and predicting global population trends using random forest regression. The combined efforts aim to address challenges in agriculture and population forecasting, providing valuable insights for sustainable development and policy-making.

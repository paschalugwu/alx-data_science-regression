# Random Forest Regression for World Population Prediction

---

## Introduction

### Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model using random forest regression to estimate the world population from 1960 to 2017, segmented by income groups. Accurate population forecasting is crucial for policymakers, economists, and various stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding resource allocation, planning, and development strategies. The primary objective is to create a model that can effectively predict population trends within different income groups using historical data.

### Personal Motivation

As a young Nigerian passionate about data science, I have always been intrigued by how data can reveal hidden insights and inform better decision-making. My background in machine learning, product management, data analysis, and software engineering has equipped me with the skills to tackle complex problems using innovative algorithms. This project aligns with my career goals by providing an opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to real-world data, enhancing my understanding of predictive modeling and its practical applications. The choice to work on this project is driven by my interest in using data to address significant global challenges, and it reflects my aspiration to contribute to impactful data-driven solutions.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preparation

**Data Sources**:  
- **Population Data**: The primary dataset contains world population figures for various countries from 1960 to 2017.
- **Metadata**: This dataset provides additional information about each country, including its income group classification.

**Data Collection Process**:  
The data was sourced from ExploreAI Academy's public repository. The population data was collected from the World Bank's records, while the metadata was curated to categorize countries into different income groups.

**Challenges Faced**:  
- **Data Integration**: Combining population data with metadata required careful handling of missing values and ensuring consistent country codes.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Some countries had incomplete population records for specific years, necessitating imputation or exclusion strategies.

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:  
- **Income Group Filtering**: The population data was filtered to include only countries within a specified income group.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created a feature matrix with the year as the independent variable and the total population as the dependent variable.
- **Data Transformation**: Converted the data to a 2D numpy array with columns representing the year and the measured population, ensuring the data type was `np.int64` for consistency and precision.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Insights from EDA**:  
- **Population Growth Trends**: Observed general population growth trends over the years across different income groups, with high-income countries showing slower growth compared to low-income countries.
- **Anomalies**: Detected significant deviations in population growth for certain countries due to historical events or data recording issues.
- **Visualization**: Created line plots to visualize population trends over time for different income groups, highlighting disparities in growth rates.

## Modeling and Implementation

### Model Selection

**Considered Models**:  
- **Linear Regression**: Simple and interpretable but insufficient for capturing complex patterns in population data.
- **Decision Trees**: Effective for non-linear relationships but prone to overfitting.
- **Random Forest Regression**: Chosen for its ability to handle complex relationships and reduce overfitting through ensemble learning.

**Rationale for Choosing Random Forest**:  
Random forest regression offers robustness against overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees, making it well-suited for capturing the complex patterns in historical population data. It also handles missing data and maintains high prediction accuracy.

**Model Training Process**:  
- **Cross-Validation**: Implemented k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model's generalizability and prevent overfitting.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjusted parameters such as the number of trees (`n_estimators`) and maximum depth to optimize performance.
- **Validation**: Evaluated model performance using mean squared error (MSE) on the testing sets for each cross-validation split.

### Implementation Details

**Libraries and Tools**:  
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: Employed for numerical operations and array handling.
- **Scikit-learn**: Utilized for model implementation, cross-validation, and evaluation.

**Code Snippets**:

```python
# Data preparation function
def get_total_pop_by_income(income_group_name='Low income'):
    if income_group_name not in meta_df['Income Group'].unique():
        raise ValueError(f"Income group '{income_group_name}' does not exist.")
    countries = meta_df[meta_df['Income Group'] == income_group_name].index
    pop_data = population_df.loc[countries].sum()
    result = np.array([pop_data.index.astype(np.int64), pop_data.values.astype(np.int64)]).T
    return result

# Cross-validation function
def sklearn_kfold_split(data, K):
    kf = KFold(n_splits=K, shuffle=False)
    folds = [(train_index, test_index) for train_index, test_index in kf.split(data)]
    return folds

# Model selection function
def best_k_model(data, data_indices):
    best_mse = float('inf')
    best_model = None
    for train_indices, test_indices in data_indices:
        X_train, y_train = data[train_indices, 0].reshape(-1, 1), data[train_indices, 1]
        X_test, y_test = data[test_indices, 0].reshape(-1, 1), data[test_indices, 1]
        model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
        mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
        if mse < best_mse:
            best_mse = mse
            best_model = model
    return best_model
```

## Results and Evaluation

### Model Performance
